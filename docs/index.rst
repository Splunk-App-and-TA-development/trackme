**Why this application?**

Splunk administrators and engineers have to spend a good amount of time and energy to on-board new data sources, another data source after another data source.

However, it is very frequent to realise after math that something when wrong, for some reason the sender stopped sending, an issue appeared, a network rule was lost...

No administrator should be informed of an issue in the data flow by the customer or end users, this is why you need pro-activity and cost less availability monitoring.

with the massive amount of data sources, this becomes easily a painful and time consuming activity, this application aims to drastically help you in these tasks.

This tiny application provides a handy user interface associated with a simple but efficient data discovery, state and alerting workflow.

Made by Splunk admins for Splunk admins, the TrackMe application provides builtin powerful features to monitor and administer you data source monitoring the easy way!
